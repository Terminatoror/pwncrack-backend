## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your project directory:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure MySQL
Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. Create a database for the project and update the credentials in `server.js`.

### 3. Update Credentials in server.js
Open `server.js` and replace the dummy credentials with your actual MySQL configurations.  
Make the following changes:
```javascript
// in server.js (line 44-49)
// ...existing code...
const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'MYSQL_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER',  // [Line 47] Replace with your MySQL password
  database: 'pwncrack'
});
// ...existing code...
```

### 4. Configure Nodemailer
Set up your SMTP settings for sending emails. In `server.js`, update the Nodemailer configuration as follows:
```javascript
// in server.js (line 380-386)
// ...existing code...
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'EMAIL_ADDRESS_PLACEHOLDER',    // [Line 382] Replace with your SMTP user/email
    pass: 'EMAIL_PASSWORD_PLACEHOLDER'      // [Line 383] Replace with your SMTP password
  },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
// ...existing code...
```

### 5. Start the Server
After completing the setup, start the backend server:
```bash
npm run start
```
